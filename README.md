# Cinema4D-Scripts
Feel free to use any of these!
generate_books_2.py: Creates instances of a book to fit my bookshelf.
assign_mats.py: Used after generate_books_2.py to randomly assign one of the colored materials I made in the scene to a book.
zero_active_objs.py: Simply sets all local transforms to 0 (or 1 for scale.)
joints_to_rot+offset_ctrls.py: In progress. Will create FK controls for a joint hierarchy.
constrain_recv_rig_4.py: In progress. Essentially I am trying to manually retarget an animated skeleton to a new skeleton which can have different proportions. Was going to use this for my motion capture data for my senior film, but Cinema 4D's Motion Solver tag works better.
