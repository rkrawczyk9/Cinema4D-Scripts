# Cinema4D Scripts
Here are some scripts I've made for my own use. Feel free to use them too!

generate_books_2.py             Creates instances of a book to fit my bookshelf.

assign_mats.py                  Used after generate_books_2.py to randomly assign one of the colored materials I made in the scene to a book.

zero_active_objs.py             Simply sets all local transforms to 0 (or 1 for scale.)

joints_to_rot+offset_ctrls.py   In progress. Will create FK controls for a joint hierarchy.

constrain_recv_rig_4.py         In progress. Essentially I am trying to manually retarget an animated skeleton to a new skeleton which can have different proportions. Was going to use this for my motion capture data for my senior film, but Cinema 4D's Motion Solver tag works better.

find#replace.py                 Batch renames selected objects. Supports inserting sequential numbers, and a way to replace any digit.
